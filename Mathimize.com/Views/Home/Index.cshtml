            example: class="asset left-472 sp600 t120 z3"
            left-472 means left: -472px from the center
            sp600 is speed transition
            t120 is top to 120px
            z3 is z-index to 3
            Note: Maintain this order of params

            For the backgrounds, you can combine from the bgs folder :D

                                Automatic recall of basic math facts (math fluency) is generally considered a key foundation for higher level math skills. Your kid can Add and Subtract. But how fast is he? Does he still use his fingers to do single digit operations? How fluent is he?

                                I do Math drills with my kids every Sunday morning. The worksheets out there were static, so I wrote simple scripts that generated dynamic worksheets for my kids. I thought other parents would also appreciate these scripts, so I started Mathimize.

    <h2>
        Welcome to Mathimize!</h2>
    <p>
        While looking online for math worksheets for my kids to practice, I was olny able to find static ones. That's fine and dandy, but at some point, you'll run out
        of worksheets to download. So I wrote a quick html page that generated random terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started with basic addition and as I saw areas that I wanted to target with my kid, I started writing more
        focused scripts, like Doubles and Tens.
    </p>
    <p>
        I figured other parents would appreciate the option to generate new and fresh worksheets each time they visited the site, or be able to customize it. So, I created Mathimize.com. This is a place where your kids can Maximize their
        Math skills.
