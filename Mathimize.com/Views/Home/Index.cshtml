        Welcome to Mathimize!</h2>
    <p>
        While looking online for math worksheets for my kids to practice, I was olny able to find static ones. That's fine and dandy, but at some point, you'll run out
        of worksheets to download. So I wrote a quick html page that generated random terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started with basic addition and as I saw areas that I wanted to target with my kid, I started writing more
        focused scripts, like Doubles and Tens.
    </p>
    <p>
        I figured other parents would appreciate the option to generate new and fresh worksheets each time they visited the site, or be able to customize it. So, I created Mathimize.com. This is a place where your kids can Maximize their
        Math skills.
